# Profile Optimization Guide - Getting 80-100% Fit Scores

## Understanding the Fit Score

The fit score is calculated using these weighted components:

| Component | Weight | How to Improve |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Domain Match** | 30% | Match your core domains to opportunity domains |
| **NAICS Match** | 20% | Add more relevant NAICS codes |
| **Technical Skill Match** | 20% | List all relevant technical skills |
| **Agency Alignment** | 10% | Add more preferred agencies |
| **Contract Type Fit** | 10% | Based on set-asides and certifications |
| **Strategic Value** | 10% | AI-determined strategic importance |

**Target: 80-100% = BID recommendation**

## Quick Wins for Higher Scores

1. **Add 5-7 more NAICS codes** → +10-15% on NAICS match
2. **Add 10-15 more technical skills** → +10-15% on skill match
3. **Add 10+ more agencies** → +5-10% on agency alignment
4. **Add all certifications** → +5-10% on contract type fit
5. **Add office locations** → Better location matching

## Expected Results

With these optimizations:
- **Domain Match:** 80-100% (already strong)
- **NAICS Match:** 70-90% (up from ~50%)
- **Technical Skill Match:** 80-95% (up from ~60%)
- **Agency Alignment:** 60-80% (up from ~40%)

**Overall Fit Score: 75-90%** (up from current ~50-60%)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update NAICS codes** in your profile
2. **Expand technical skills** list
3. **Add more preferred agencies**
4. **List all certifications** you have/are eligible for
5. **Add office locations**
6. **Save profile** and re-score opportunities

## Pro Tips

- **Be specific** with technical skills (e.g., "AWS Lambda" not just "AWS")
- **Include variations** (e.g., "Kubernetes" and "K8s")
- **Add emerging tech** (e.g., "Generative AI", "RAG", "LLM Ops")
- **Update regularly** as you gain new capabilities
- **Match keywords** from actual opportunities you see
